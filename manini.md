---

**_The One who is Viyog or SEPARATION in Love_**

Devi Kaalika is the mild periods of separation in Love.  
She projects as anger or disappointment in Maa Radha, towards Krishna when he displeases her.

**Manini** merely denotes her **displeasure rooted in pure love** towards her beloved Sadhaka.
