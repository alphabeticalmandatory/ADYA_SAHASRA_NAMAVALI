<blockquote class="subtitle">
  The One who is Viyog or SEPARATION in Love
</blockquote>

<div class="description">
  Devi Kaalika is the mild periods of separation in Love.<br><br>
  She projects as anger or disappointment in Maa Radha, towards Krishna when he displeases her.<br><br>
  <strong>Manini</strong> merely denotes her <strong>displeasure rooted in pure love</strong> towards her beloved Sadhaka.
