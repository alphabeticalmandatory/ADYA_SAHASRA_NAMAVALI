<h1>Devi Kaalika is Gunaatit. What does it mean?</h1>
This term is often misunderstood as being so high that they are simply and completely above the three Gunas, which means they’re without any nature of the Gunas. 
However, the true meaning is that the Deity is in perfect harmony between the Three Guna, hence, the Deity is not under the influence of One Guna among the MahaVidhyas, Kalalika represents Tamas, Tarini represents Sattva and Tripura Sundari represents Rajas. 
However, here one must understand that it does not mean that Maa Kaalika is limited to Thomas. 
No, it is merely like the baby that gestated for 10 months inside the Womb. 
Similarly a minor fraction of Tamas can birth the entire Mahavidya’s, which means a baby that has been gestated for 10 months, will have an exceptional life of 125 years Here Mahakali represents tamas in the Mahavidya simply because it is the birthing ground of the Mahavidyas. She teaches the most powerful Guna, which is the mastery of the tamas, thereby allowing us to then proceed towards Rajas (Tripura Sundari )and Satwa (Tarini), Kaalika however Is the creator of Tripura Sundari and Tarini, to teach the Triangle. Read Below. 
Kaalika - Tripura Sundari - Tarini. 
This is the triangle, one moves from Kali to spending lifetimes in the service of Tripura Sundari, then moving back to Tarini, and the finally back to Kaalika. 
The Perfect Harmony of all Gunas, mastery of it all - Kaalika.
